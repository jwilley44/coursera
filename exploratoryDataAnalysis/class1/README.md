# Plot Household Power Consumption Data
Simple scripts to plot power consumption data. To run:
```
./plotData1.R
./plotData2.R
./plotData3.R
./plotData4.R
```
This will produce 4 PNG files.  
NOTE: Since GitHub has limitations on the file size, you will need to place the text file in the directory and give it the name "household_power_consumption.txt"
